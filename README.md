# yoga-pose-estimation

Starter project to learn how to preform pose estimation on something that I already have an interest in: yoga.

In short, Pytube module will be used to scrape yt video data from a few popular youtube channels.

Then, using both google's and AWS's tools to preform the pose-estimation.
